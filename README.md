# Streamlit + Langchain + Ollama w/ Mistral

Run your own AI Chatbot locally on a GPU or even a CPU.

To make that possible, we use the [Mistral 7b](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/) model.  
We will run use an LLM inference engine called [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) to run our LLM and to serve  
an inference api endpoint and have LangChain connect to it instead of running the LLM directly.

This AI chatbot will allow you to define its personality and respond to the questions accordingly.  
There is no chat memory in this iteration, so you won't be able to ask follow-up questions.
The chatbot will essentially behave like a Question/Answer bot.
