# Streamlit + Langchain + Ollama w/ Mistral

Run your own AI Chatbot locally on a GPU or even a CPU.

To make that possible, we use the [Mistral 7b](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/) model.  
However, you can use any quantized model that is supported by [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp).

This AI chatbot will allow you to define its personality and respond to the questions accordingly.  
There is no chat memory in this iteration, so you won't be able to ask follow-up questions.
The chatbot will essentially behave like a Question/Answer bot.
